        <h2>Chorizo Shakshuka</h2>

        <p>Combine onion, roasted red bell peppers, artichoke hearts, tomatoes (including liquid), tomato paste, garlic, dried oregano, paprika, ground cumin, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a slow cooker.
Cover and cook on low for 7 to 8 hours or high for 4 to 5 hours (after cooking, the shakshuka can hold on warm for up to 4 hours before serving).
If cooking on low, turn the slow cooker to high.
Remove the lid.
Working with one egg at a time, crack the egg into a Â¼ cup measuring cup. Use the measuring cup to make an indentation in shakshuka and gently pour egg into the indentation. Continue with all remaining eggs.
Cover and cook for 20 to 25 minutes more until eggs whites are set and egg yolks are still slightly soft.
Serve shakshuka with cheese and parsley on top and pita, naan, or toasted bread for dipping.</p>
